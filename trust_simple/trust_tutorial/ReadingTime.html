    <h3>What Is Charisma?</h3>
    <p>
        Charisma is rooted in values and feelings. It’s influence born of the alchemy that Aristotle called the <strong>logos</strong>, the <strong>ethos</strong>, and the <strong>pathos</strong>; that is, to persuade others, you must use powerful and reasoned rhetoric, establish personal and moral credibility, and then rouse followers’ emotions and passions. If a leader can do those three things well, he or she can then tap into the hopes and ideals of followers, give them a sense of purpose, and inspire them to achieve great things.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our research, we have identified a dozen key charismatic leadership tactics (i.e., CLTs). Some of them you may recognize as long-standing techniques of oratory. Nine of them are verbal: metaphors, similes, and analogies; stories and anecdotes; contrasts; rhetorical questions; three-part lists; expressions of moral conviction; reflections of the group’s sentiments; the setting of high goals; and conveying confidence that they can be achieved. Three tactics are nonverbal: animated voice, facial expressions, and gestures.
    </p>

    <h4>Connect, Compare, and Contrast</h4>
    <p>
        Charismatic speakers help listeners understand, relate to, and remember a message. A powerful way to do this is by using metaphors, similes, and analogies. Martin Luther King Jr. was a master of the metaphor. In his “I Have a Dream” speech, for example, he likened the U.S. Constitution to “a promissory note” guaranteeing the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all people but noted that America had instead given its black citizens “a bad check,” one that had come back marked “insufficient funds.” Everyone knows what it means to receive a bad check. The message is crystal clear and easy to retain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Metaphors can be effective in any professional context, too. Joe, a manager we worked with, used one to predispose his team to get behind an urgent relocation. He introduced it by saying: “When I heard about this from the board, it was like hearing about a long-awaited pregnancy. The difference is that we have four months instead of nine months to prepare.” The team instantly understood it was about to experience an uncomfortable but ultimately rewarding transition.
    </p>

    <h4>Stories and Anecdotes</h4>
    <p>
        Stories and anecdotes also make messages more engaging and help listeners connect with the speaker. Even people who aren’t born raconteurs can employ them in a compelling way. Take this example from a speech Bill Gates gave at Harvard, urging graduates to consider their broader responsibilities: “My mother…never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a bridal event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of the letter she [quoted]: ‘From those to whom much is given, much is expected.’”
    </p>
    <p>
        Lynn, another manager we studied, used the following story to motivate her reports during a crisis: “This reminds me of the challenge my team and I faced when climbing the Eiger peak a few years ago. We got caught in bad weather, and we could have died up there. But working together, we managed to survive. And we made what at first seemed impossible, possible. Today we are in an economic storm, but by pulling together, we can turn this situation around and succeed.” The story made her team feel reassured and inspired.
    </p>

    <h4>Contrasts</h4>
    <p>
        Contrasts are a key CLT because they combine reason and passion; they clarify your position by pitting it against the opposite, often to dramatic effect. Think of John F. Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” In our experience, contrasts are one of the easiest tactics to learn and use, and yet they aren’t used enough. Here are some examples from managers newly trained in the CLTs. Gilles, a senior VP, speaking to a direct report managing a stagnant team: “It seems to me that you’re playing too much defense when you need to be playing more offense.” (That’s also a metaphor.) And Sally, introducing herself to her new team: “I asked to lead the medical division not because it has the best location but because I believe we can accomplish something great for our company and at the same time help save lives.”
    </p>

    <h4>Engage and Distill</h4>
    <p>
        Rhetorical questions might seem hackneyed, but charismatic leaders use them all the time to encourage engagement. Questions can have an obvious answer or pose a puzzle to be answered later. Think again of Martin Luther King Jr., who said, “There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ‘When will you be satisfied?,’” and then went on to show that oppressed people can never be satisfied. Anita Roddick—founder of the Body Shop—once used three rhetorical questions to explain what led her to help start the social responsibility movement. The thinking, she said, “was really simple: How do you make business kinder? How do you embed it in the community? How do you make community a social purpose for business?”
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Passion cannot emerge unless the leader truly believes in the vision. This belief inspires teams to rise to challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes.

                <h2>Storytelling Task</h2>
                <p>Your team needs to write a compelling story to include in a donation campaign letter for sick kids. The idea is to appeal to emotions, values, and make it as compelling as possible to motivate people to donate.</p>

                <p><strong>You can see this task as a contest:</strong> the best story will win an additional cash prize of $50 to share between the two team members.</p>

                <h3>Details about the Task</h3>
                <p>Your story will be inserted into the following letter:</p>

                <div style="border: 2px solid #ffd700; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; background-color: #fffbea;">
                    <p><strong>Dear [potential donor’s name],</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I’m reaching out to share an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of children who are fighting serious illnesses. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is dedicated to helping families during some of their hardest days, providing care, comfort, and support when they need it most.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each year, many gravely ill children spend their holidays in the hospital. For these families, Christmas isn’t a time of celebration but one of worry and uncertainty. This is where your support can bring light. Your donation helps us provide crucial resources—whether it’s funding accommodations so parents can stay close to their children, decorating rooms to create a festive, comforting environment, or setting up playrooms filled with toys to bring smiles to the faces of kids who need it the most.
                    </p>
                    <div style="background-color: yellow; padding: 10px; font-style: italic;">
                        [Your story here. Write a paragraph that illustrates the impact of donating to a sick child.]
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Every donation makes an impact. Just as each letter we send out can reach someone who wants to help, every contribution we receive allows us to reach more families and make their holidays brighter, even within hospital walls. Your generosity goes beyond a simple gift; it becomes a source of hope and comfort, helping to create lasting memories for families facing unimaginable challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                <blockquote style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    “Have you heard of the hummingbird that wanted to make a difference? One day there was a huge forest fire. All the animals fled dismayed, discouraged to see the forest burning. They felt very helpless. Except one bird, a little hummingbird. The hummingbird thought it would do something to fight the fire. So it flew to the nearest stream, took a drop of water in its beak, and flew to throw it on the fire. It descended, rose, and descended as quickly as it could. Drop by drop. Meanwhile, the animals, who by joining their forces, could bring much more water, did nothing. They said to the hummingbird: "But what do you think you can do, this fire is way too big for you. How will you extinguish the fire with drops?" Without wasting a moment, it turned to them, looked them in the eye, and said: "At least I did my part."”
                </blockquote>
